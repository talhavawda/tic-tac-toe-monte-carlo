        "# Introduction and Background\n",
        "Our variant on Tic Tac Toe is one that is aimed to make the game more interesting. The original game involves of lining up 3 of the same type of token (X or O) on a row, column or diagonal, in a 3 by 3 grid in order to win. There are 3 types of tokens that are used in our variant: \"X\",\"Y\" and \"S\". The X and Y tokens are the player tokens (to be used by each of the 2 players) while the S tokens are universal tokens that are placed randomly on the board before the game commences. The S token may be used by either player as a their own in order to allow themselves to win the game faster. Measures have been taken to prevent the S tokens from giving an unfair advantage to 1 player. These include: not allowing S tokens to be placed in the same row and column, and also ensuring no to S tokens will be more less than 2 spaces away from each other on the diagonals. Our variant allows the game to played on the following square grid sizes: 4 by 4, 5 by 5, 6 by 6 and 7 by 7. Furthermore for a 4 by 4 grid you are only required to line up 3 of the same tokens on a row, column or diagonal to win. Similary, for a 5 by 5 and 6 by 6 grid, you are only required to line up 4 tokens and with a 7 by 7, you must line up 5 tokens to win. The tokens one lines up to win may consist of only 1 type of player token (X or Y) or 1 type of player token and an S token.\n"
